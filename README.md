Public perception of hospital services

Geographic variations in hospital satisfaction

Key factors contributing to service quality issues

The results can inform policymakers, healthcare providers, and stakeholders to improve service delivery.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Assess citizens' sentiment towards hospital services in Nigeria.

Identify critical factors affecting service quality (e.g., infrastructure, waiting times, staff professionalism).

Map geographical variations in hospital service perception.

Provide actionable insights for healthcare policy and hospital management.
